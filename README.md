I've created this simple weather app to learn React.

### Sandbox

The sandbox will be launched when using `npm run install && npm run start`. The data which is used is from the JSON
file `src/mock_data.json`.

### Production

To load real data based on your coordinates use `npm run production` and then `serve -s build`. Please make sure you
have **serve** installed. If not, run `npm install -g serve`.
